This notebook features implementation of three models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost.
The dataset used is from a COVID-19 hesitancy study.
We determined which model perfomed best in classifying whether a patient took the vaccine or not.
We used explainable ML techniques to get insight on how the models work.
Permutation Feature Importance, Partial Dependance Plots were used
