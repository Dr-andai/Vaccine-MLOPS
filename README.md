# Project Overview

This project has two main components:
- Implementation of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithims on a COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Dataset
- Setup of an MLOPs pipeline

## ML Algorithm
This notebook features implementation of three models: 
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost.
The dataset used is from a COVID-19 hesitancy study:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/5/705.
We determined which model perfomed best in classifying whether a patient took the vaccine or not.

Explainable ML techniques like Permutation Feature Importance and Partial Dependence Plots provide insights into model behavior.

## MLOPS
The second part of the project is a conceptualisation of an MLOPs project for the same dataset.

Project status: continuing
